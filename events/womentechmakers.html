					Google believes diversity and inclusion is important for thriving vibrant communities. Focusing on women-inclusion is the first step in a larger effort to diversify the global Google developer community. The GDG community has shown great interest in this initiative, starting with DevFestW last year, so we'll push it forward with this year's <a href="http://womentechmakers.com/">Women Techmakers</a> event series.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify">
